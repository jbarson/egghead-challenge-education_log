# Education Logging Snippets

As an educator I find myself logging examples to the console on almost a daily basis. The issue is that all of the messages look the same, and it can be hard for students to pick out the key points of a demo while looking at a wall of text.

In order to scratch my own itch, I have decided to create some snippets to give some pizazz to the console and make it easier to pick up the gist of the demo.

## Snippets

| Snippet | Output             |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| `edmb`  | Mind Blown         |
| `edti`  | New section        |
| `edw`   | Be careful of this |
| `ednv`  | Never Do this      |
| `edtf`  | Table Flip         |
